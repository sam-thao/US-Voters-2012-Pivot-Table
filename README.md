# Exploring 2012 Voter Data: Unveiling Turnout Trends
This document outlines an analysis of 2012 voter data to understand turnout patterns across various demographics and states. We'll utilize pivot tables and calculated fields to gain valuable insights.

# Data Preparation:

## Control a Select Data: Identify and select relevant data columns for analysis, including state, citizen population, and confirmed voters.
Insert New Pivot Table: Create a new pivot table on a separate worksheet to organize and manipulate the data efficiently.
Research Questions:

## State-Level Turnout Comparison: How does voter turnout vary across different states?
Age-Based Turnout: Do specific age groups exhibit higher or lower voter participation?
National vs. State Trends: Are national turnout patterns consistent across all states, or are there unique trends in individual states?
Pivot Table Formatting:

## Rows: State
Values:
Sum of Citizen Population
Sum of Confirmed Voters
Formatting:
Sum columns with commas.
Sort rows by descending sum of citizen populations.
Calculated Field: Create a ratio of confirmed voters to citizen population for percentage turnout.
Percentage Formatting: Apply percentage formatting to the new column.
Resorting: Re-sort the table by Voter Population percentage, highlighting the District of Columbia with a 76% turnout.
Adding Age Data:

## Include "Age" as a row or column dimension to reveal age-related trends.
Top states likely show higher concentrations of older voters.
Younger voters may show lower but still significant participation.
Bottom states might exhibit:
Strong older voter turnout.
Lower younger voter participation.
State-Specific Analysis:

## Use filters to focus on specific age groups within individual states.
Add another "Sum of Confirmed Voters2" calculated field for the chosen age group.
Format "Confirmed Voters2" as a percentage of the column total.
Observe the percentage of 18-24 year old voters, noting those below 10% in specific states.
Bring "State" back as a primary row dimension for granular analysis.
Reformat "Confirmed Voters2" as a percentage of the state population.
Identify states where younger voters contribute less than 10% to the overall turnout.
Summary:

## This analysis provides a framework for exploring 2012 voter data and uncovering fascinating trends related to turnout across states and demographic groups. By manipulating the data through pivot tables and calculated fields, we can gain valuable insights into voting patterns and inform future outreach efforts or policy initiatives.

## Feel free to adapt and expand this framework to address additional research questions or delve deeper into specific aspects of the data. By applying analytical techniques and drawing informed conclusions, we can gain a clearer understanding of voter behavior and ultimately strengthen our democratic processes.
